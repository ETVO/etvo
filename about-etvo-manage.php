      etvo-manage is an idea -- <b>blocks</b>. Nothing more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>It is not a state of the art system that is going to revolutionize industry.</b>
      <br>
      <b>It is simply easy to understand and straight forward to extend</b>, which means that every website gets exactly what it needs.
    </p>
    <h3>Everything is blocks.</h3>
    <p>
      A page is a collection of blocks, such as the Hero and the Contact Form.
    </p>

      <figcaption>
        Inside a block, you might find:
      </figcaption>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>attributes</b>, such as a title and a description,
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>other blocks</b>, such as a Call to Action or Social Media Icons,
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>and even collections of blocks</b>, such as Services or Projects.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </figure>
